* Network - (not related to newtorking) - The network model builds on the heirarchical model by allowing many-to-many relationships between linked records, implying multiple parent recrds. Ex: IDMS
* Relational - consists of tables that can be linked in one to one, one to many, or many to many relationship - MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server
  * NoSQL Databse - NoSQL database technology stores information in JSON documents instead of columns and rows used by relational databses. ("not only SQL")
    * Ex: Cassandra, HBase, Hypertable
* Graph - A graph database (GDB) is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data

## Brands of Relational DBMS
* Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
* Oracle
* MySql
* Microsoft Access
* PostgreSQL
